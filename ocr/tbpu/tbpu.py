# tbpu : text block processing unit
# The base class of a text block processor.
# An element of the result returned by OCR that contains text, enclosing boxes, and confidence levels is called a "text block".
# A text block is not necessarily a complete sentence or paragraph. Instead, it is usually fragmented text.
# An OCR result often consists of multiple text blocks.
# A text block processor is a processor that takes multiple incoming text blocks and processes them, such as merging, sorting, and deleting them.
